What I'm interested in:

Using data analysis and machine learning to help guide conversations about criminal justice and mental health:
* bond amounts based on crime and criminal record
    * One of my long-term goals is to develop an AI/ML judicial commissioner that can set equitable bond amounts and be available 24/7, especially for rural communities where courts are in session only once or twice a month.
* final dispositions of cases based on charges
* rates of reversals of convictions through appeal and habeas corpus
* demographics of jurisdictions, judges and attorneys who successful divert criminal cases into drug and/or mental health rehabilitation 
Shoutout to my friends at the [Jackson (TN) Recovery Court](https://www.jacksontn.gov/government/departments/city_court/recovery_court) who are saving lives every day through their tireless mentorship of people beating substance addictions. 

Any type of geospatial data, especially for my hometown of [Stow-without-the-e, Massachusetts](https://www.stow-ma.gov/), my current hometown of Memphis, Tennessee, and my dream hometown of Jerusalem (hoping for Israel, but I suppose [Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem,_Ohio), [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem,_New_York), [Arkansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem,_Arkansas), or [Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jerusalem,_Maryland&oldformat=true) could work).  Yeah, I'm kind of a geography nerd, still proud of reaching the state geography bee in 6th grade!)

* economic, political, and the relationship between the two 
* public transit (even though I now walk to work and still miss when I drove 72 miles each way every day)
* real estate prices (and real estate taxes) 
* crime
* educational success (K-12, undergrad and graduate by hometown and location of school)

Pure math, especially number theory - I'm annoyed that Andrew Wiles beat me to the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.  Still working on proving that there are [no odd perfect numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number), but I'm telling people that ["I have discovered a truly remarkable proof of this theorem which this margin is too small to contain."](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat) 

Dating.  My wife and I are happily married (two adorable rascals in almost 10 years, thank G-d :-) ), but we moonlight as online matchmakers.  I'm interested in developing models to help guide matchmaking based on demographics and to help singles write targeted personal descriptions.

MLB and KBO baseball.  There's so much you can do with statistics, but there aren't many things in life (other than my family, of course) more beautiful than a [Pedro Martinez breaking ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hq5jfMuSS8) or a [Tim Wakefield knuckball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j8Nemg9fAM).  (And perhaps nothing sillier than a [Craig Kimbrel windup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T80GETwzqqM)).
