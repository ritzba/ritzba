* bond amounts based on crime and criminal record
    * One of my long-term goals is to develop an AI/ML judicial commissioner that can set equitable bond amounts and be available 24/7, especially for rural communities where courts are in session only once or twice a month.
* final dispositions of cases based on charges
* rates of reversals of convictions through appeal and habeas corpus
* demographics of jurisdictions, judges and attorneys who successfully divert criminal cases into drug and/or mental health rehabilitation.  (Shoutout to my friends at the [Jackson (TN) Recovery Court](https://www.jacksontn.gov/government/departments/city_court/recovery_court) who are saving lives every day through their tireless mentorship of people beating substance addictions.)

Especially for my hometown of [Stow-without-the-e, Massachusetts](https://www.stow-ma.gov/), my current hometown of Memphis, Tennessee, and my dream hometown of Jerusalem (hoping for Israel, but I suppose [Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem,_Ohio), [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem,_New_York), [Arkansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem,_Arkansas), or [Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jerusalem,_Maryland&oldformat=true) could work).  Yeah, I'm kind of a geography nerd, still proud of reaching the state geography bee in 6th grade!

* economic, political, and the relationship between the two 
* public transit (even though I now walk to work and still miss when I drove 72 miles each way every day)
* real estate prices (and real estate taxes) 
* crime
* educational success (K-12, undergrad and graduate by hometown and location of school)

## Rabbinic Judaism

Ritzba is a Hebrew acronym for **R**euven **TZ**vi **B**en **E**liezer

* modeling the frequency, topics, and style of rabbinic citations in the Babylonian Talmud 
* using NLP to predict cantillation marks based on Biblical grammar and syntax

## Pure math (especially number theory)

I'm annoyed that Andrew Wiles beat me to the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.  Still working on proving that there are [no odd perfect numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number), but I'm telling people that ["I have discovered a truly remarkable proof of this theorem which this margin is too small to contain."](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat) 

## Dating

My wife and I are happily married (two adorable rascals in almost 10 years, thank G-d :-) ), but we moonlight as online matchmakers.  I'm interested in developing models to help guide matchmaking based on demographics and to help singles write targeted personal descriptions.

## MLB and KBO baseball

There's so much you can do with statistics, but there aren't many things in life (other than [my family](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10220977064712590&set=t.4101991&type=3), of course) more beautiful than a [Pedro Martinez breaking ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hq5jfMuSS8) or a [Tim Wakefield knuckleball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j8Nemg9fAM).  (And perhaps nothing sillier than a [Craig Kimbrel windup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T80GETwzqqM)).
